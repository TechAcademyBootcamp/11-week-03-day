## Create five book, three author and five category objects using first task models.

*For example:*
```
Book object ⇒ title:Robinson Crusoe, description: [some text], author: Daniel Defoe, price:12.5, page count:210, cover image:[image path ]
Author object ⇒ fullname:Daniel Defoe, image:[image path], gender:Male, date of birthday: Feb. 2 1817, nationality: British, info:[some text]
Category object ⇒ title:Adventure

**It is important to remember that each book must have one author and several categories.**
